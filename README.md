Dubbo is a distributed, high performance RPC framework which empowers applications with service import/export capabilities.

It contains three key parts, which include:

* **Remoting**: a network communication framework providing sync-over-async and request-response messaging.
* **Clustering**: a remote procedure call abstraction with load-balancing/failover/clustering capabilities.
* **Registration**: a service directory framework for service registration and service event publish/subscription
